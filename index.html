      <h3>Hi, my name is</h3>
      <h1>Rishona Lee</h1>
      <h2>Aspiring Front-end Developer based in the United States</h2>
      <p class="homepage-about">
        My journey into the world of coding all started during a holiday
        weekend. As I was relaxing and scrolling through my phone, I came upon
        an article about a Speech Language Pathologist (my current area of
        expertise) who had switched careers and had become a Software Developer.
        After reading this article, I felt mystified about such a transition in
        careers, but also very intrigued. That night I began to investigate
        coding further and within a week, I had started an online workshop, with
        the goal to become a Front-end Developer. A wise man once told me when
        you are looking for answers you have to be open and be ready to listen
        to the Universe. I have no doubt that the Universe pointed me in this
        unexpected but very exciting direction. I have truly found a passion for
        coding and am excited to continue my learning journey. Please enjoy my
        portfolio!

        SheCodes Workshops. This section will continue to grow along with my
        skills as I become a more experienced developer.
