            I was born and raised in Cleveland, Ohio and live with my husband,
            our yellow lab Bella and our tiny cat Olive. I've lived in Colorado
            and South Florida and been fortunate to have done some traveling
            around the world, spending time in Italy, Ireland, and Israel to
            name a few.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my free time, I enjoy reading murder mysteries, working outside,
            developing my coding skills, eating great food and running. I am an
            avid runner and have run 2 marathons and a handful of half marathons
            to date.
          </p>
          <p>
            I received my Master's degree in Speech Language Pathology and have
            worked with both children and adults for over 15 years in a varity
            of settings. My current position is Lead Speech Language Pathologist
            at a rehabiliation and long term care center for adults. I have
            enjoyed providing direct patient care to help patients improve their
            lives, educating families, working on an interdisciplinay team, and
            leading others over the years but am now ready to make a significant
            transition with my career.

            I am so excited that I accidently found the world of coding and have
            immensely enjoyed learing and beginning to develop my doding skills
            over the last 4 months through SheCodes Workshops. I am a fast
            learner and am amazed at how much I have learned in a short time and
            how excited I am to continue to keep learning.
